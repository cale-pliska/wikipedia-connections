### Discover inspiring connections between K-12 topics and student interests.
## Age Old Education Problem
The age-old problem in K-12 education is that students do not have enough “real-life” experience to understand - by themselves - how their course material connects to something they care about and teachers cannot draw these connections for each student.

“When will I ever use {algebra, irrational numbers, pythagorean's theorem}?  I hate math, and I don’t want to be a mathematician.  “When will I ever use {insert any topic}? I hate {this topic} and I don’t want to be {someone who only studies that topic}.”

We have all spoken or thought these exact same words at some point going through K-12 education.  When teachers explore these hard questions with students it builds trust, curiosity, and engagement with course material because it persuades them that what they are learning right now is important and relates to each student.
## Solution
Teachers, students, or parents can search any topic from any course and Excited2Learn provides a dashboard that makes it easy to discover connections and examples between what students are learning and their interests.  The dashboard uses interactive graphs and search filters so students can explore the connections between what they are learning and other subjects, people, events, careers, or topics students love.

Teachers can organize the connections they find based on the units they teach to make it easy to inspire students at the start of a new unit.  These connections can be shared with other teachers to help make connections between other courses students are taking.  Connections can also be shared to students and parents to further explore these connections at home.

## Specific Use Case Ideas for Teachers to Start a New Unit
Individual/Group Project: Have students work as a group or individually to search the new topics they will learn, explore the connections that are interesting to them, and create something to express the connections they discovered.

In-class Exploration & Demo: As a class, search the new topics you will learn and have an interactive discussion and exploration about how the topic connects to other topics.
