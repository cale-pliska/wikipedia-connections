A purely imaginary number bi is a complex number 0 + bi , whose real part is zero. As with polynomials, it is common to write a for a + 0 i and bi for 0 + bi . Moreover, when the imaginary part is negative, that is, b = \u2212 |b| < 0 , it is common to write a \u2212 |b|i instead of a + (\u2212 |b| ) i ; for example, for b = \u22124 , 3 \u2212 4 i can be written instead of 3 + (\u22124) i ."]}, "Control theory": {"categories": ["Control theory", "Control engineering", "Computer engineering", "Cybernetics"], "navbox": ["Control theory", "Subfields of and cyberneticians involved in cybernetics", "Systems science", "Mathematics"], "examples": ["which has a pole in z = 0.5 {\\displaystyle z=0.5} (zero imaginary part ).
